        <p>hello world,</p>

        <p>This is my first web page. I am building this from scratch and will revise the page with new features and content as and when I learn/get them. So this is a work in progress.</p>

                <p>Almost the first half of the day was spent rearranging the lab, keeping stuff organized. Then we were introduced to the Fab Academy program, <a href="http://fabacademy.org/archive/courses/index.html">                              archives</a> of the previous years, lecture by Neil. We were told about the assignments and project and importance of the documentation of the same in evaluation. We were introduced to the software/hardware  communication tools used in the program for the video conferencing. One of the tools I liked was the Linphone, mainly because it is supported in Linux and has an android app. We were all introduced to each     other on the first day. On the second day one more person joined the program, Mr Dentis Thomas. Mr Luciano sent us a google form to fill, asking for details like our interests, what we are good at, languages   and skills we have etc, softwares and tools we have experience with etc.
                </p>

                <p>I was very happy to know that Linux is the preferred OS (except for the 3D Cad softwares), because I’m familiar with it. I always carry a portable HDD with a Ubuntu installed, it has everything I need. So just                    plug it into any available system, boot and I’m ready to go. I just need to update the OS with the latest packages and setup a few tools like <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/">mercurial</a>, git (we will later move on to git). Since I was familiar                    with Linux and I already have my OS (UBUNTU 14.04.3) ready. I spent time helping others setup Linux and basics of the terminal and Linux file structure and the concept of permission. I (with my friend Yadu, who                    is also familiar Linux) helped some of the participants to setup Linux in their machines, some of them preferred standalone installations along with Windows/Mac, while some preferred virtual machines.
                </p>

                <p>From the third day onwards we were introduced to the 3D-cad. The tool we used was Rhino, unfortunately it’s not available for Linux and it’s not free, not open-source... And the best CAD software in Linux is                      Blender and it’s too complicated. So I had to switch to Linux. Of course I could have used wine or a virtual machine, but from my past experience with wine I don’t find it stable enough, especially with                            advanced tools or games that are graphically heavy. The idea of a windows inside a virtual machine running on a portable Linux running from a Usb 2.0 HDD doesn’t sound good. So I decided to switch to windows                      when I need to use the Rhino. We were given number of small assignments, though I had used softwares like SolidWorks before, rhino felt a bit difficult to begin with. May be because of my SolidWorks skills are                    rusted.
                </p>

                <p>On the last day of week1 (it was an holiday we decided not to have, but for Thiruvananthpuram batch it was), Mr Francisco Sanchez, Friend, former student, and co-tutor of Mr Luciano visited us and spent the day                    with us. He introduced us to a new tool named Antimony, a parametrical graph based 2.5D-CAD tool, also open source and can be compiled for linux.

                  <li>Had trouble installing the softwares <h6>*link*</h6></li>
                  <li>finally i decided to install the latest version from the git, but it breaks the compatibility with the files (*.cad) from the previous versions. But the idea is the same. But anyway I find this                             tool to be unnecessarily complicated to achieve a simple task of designing the PCB. So I will continue to use the for common tools like Eagle-CAD or KICAD.
